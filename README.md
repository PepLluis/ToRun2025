# Hidden jobs for projects to run in 2025

Often, work is not visible until it is abandoned or completed. I have been working very hard for the last two years on four main areas:

1) Digital manufacturing projects to support Urbanism/Civil Projects under the OsonaMakers Group. These include sharing knowledge about the Azure cloud and Visual Studio development tools, as well as frameworks such as nanoFramework, WebAssembly, React, Blazor, IoTHub, as well as teaching electronics programs in C#.
2) Organizing "Azure Immersive experience summit", where I share a bootcamp to concentrate the best experts in Azure Stack / HCI / Azure IoT (IoTOperations) / AIoT in a weekend.
3) Completing an Azure DataHub in .NET, and transitioning it to .NET Aspire.
4) Trying to relaunch groups with face-to-face events through the OsonaMakers and AzureIoT groups on LinkedIn.
