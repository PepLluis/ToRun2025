2) Organizing "Azure Immersive experience summit", where I share a bootcamp to concentrate the best experts in Azure Stack / HCI / Azure IoT (IoTOperations) / AIoT in a weekend.

Text shared with all people interested.

First draft: Azure immersive experience summit / Weekend LAB
Coming back to home with HP and Azure Stack

For MS technical communities something like:
Azure immersive experience summit

The idea would be to do it in February or March 2025 so as not to have time problems.
The organization of Zaragoza would be led by Raúl and Nacho, we can count on them both in the organization and to give a session since they have worked a lot with Azure Stack.
We would count on the support of the Zaragoza Center for Advanced Technologies (CTA) with the years they have been collaborating and they told us that they were interested in moving events related to these technologies.

The CTA has a searchable database of 5000 IT professionals from Aragon that could use for the dissemination of the event, in addition to talking to a couple of contacts in university centers (Universidad de Zaragoza, Universidad de San Jorge, Escuela Universitaria de La Almunia, CESTE, etc.) and we are waiting to speak with the city council of Zaragoza since we've been talking to them for a few months now and we're about to present a schedule of events. Regarding the location for the event, we have several locations identified that will be possible use depending on the dates, all of them given by the entities so that we can give them talks

The CTA has a great room, but if it is at the end of the week it cannot be used, other possible locations are located near the AVE station, so they are ideal for facilitating access for people coming from outside and possible speakers. guests
Regarding the speakers, we have the possibility of having colleagues from different associations in Zaragoza, in addition to several MVPs and technicians of different profiles.
What we would need to start moving would be to have an infrastructure to which we can connect and be able to do all the necessary tests, prepare the laboratories, etc.
The ideal would be to have the ?sicament infrastructure to be able to do all the tests with greater flexibility, but since this is complicated we adapt to what HP may have, as long as it is
enough to set up the necessary laboratories.

At this point I would like to show the latest version of Windows Server 2025 which should be released shortly (details under NDA) and we think we could test the improvements that this operating system brings for HCI.
On the other hand, we would take advantage of the availability of the infrastructure to generate articles, tutorials and videos (possibly webcast) in which there should be these technologies and reference should be made to the collaborating companies, always with the proper authorization, even if we assume it might interest them.

Regarding the sessions, we are always friends to do the sessions, the most
possible practices and techniques to talk about topics such as:

· Azure Stack HCI deployment.
· Integration with Azure Policy.
· Extending Azure security to our enterprise.
· AKS deployment.
· Disaster Recovery based on HCI.
· Automation of Deployments.
· Centralized administration.

By the way, for the part we have touched on, we will set up some story about AIoT.
We are considering bringing the talk to the University of Andorra as part of an event we have organized a few years ago under the name of GAPAND.
